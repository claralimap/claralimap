## 🌷 About Me

I'm currently learning and building my path as a full-stack developer, with a growing interest in Artificial Intelligence.

Right now, I'm focused on improving my technical foundation, building real projects, and becoming more confident with every commit I push.

Tech, for me, is creativity + logic working together.
